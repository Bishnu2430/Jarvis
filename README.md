An AI assistant is a software application designed to simulate human-like interactions by understanding natural language and responding intelligently. It uses machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to perform various tasks such as answering questions, scheduling appointments, providing recommendations, and more. AI assistants can be voice-activated or text-based, and they are commonly found in devices like smartphones, smart speakers, and computers. Examples include Siri, Google Assistant, and ChatGPT, each designed to enhance productivity, provide information, and streamline daily tasks through automation and conversational interfaces.
